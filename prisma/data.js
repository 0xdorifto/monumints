The structure was built from lioz limestone and is composed of a bastion and a 30-metre (100 ft),four-storey tower.",

    poem: "By the sea, a tower stands fierce and high, Guardian sentinel 'neath the azure sky. Its walls, a fortress against invaders' might, In the dance of battle, it stands upright.\nStormy seas may rage, and invaders assail, But the tower stands firm, in the face of the gale.Beneath moonlit banners, the clash begins, Metal meeting metal, as the battle spins.
